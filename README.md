# NoteDetector-Arduino
The purpose of this project is to identify the musical notes played by musical instruments by recording the frequency of the sounds with an Aduino-compatible microphone and transmitting the information to the machine learning model that will be used to classify the notes. It aims to develop a cost effective and simple to assemble note detection system to hobbyists and students.
