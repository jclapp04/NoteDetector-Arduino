# NoteDetector-Arduino
This project aims to detect musical notes played by instruments by capturing sound frequencies through an Arduino-compatible microphone and sending the data to a machine learning model that classifies the notes. The goal is to create an affordable, easy-to-build note detection system for hobbyists and students.
